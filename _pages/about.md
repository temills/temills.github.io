I am a PhD student in MIT's [Brain and Cognitive Sciences Department](https://bcs.mit.edu/), working with [Josh Tenenbaum](https://cocosci.mit.edu/josh) in the [Computational Cognitive Science Lab](https://cocosci.mit.edu/) and [Sam Gershman](https://gershmanlab.com/people/sam.html) in the [Computational Cognitive Neuroscience Lab](https://gershmanlab.com/). Previously, I completed my undergrad in Computer Science and Cognitive Science at Dartmouth College where I worked with [Jonathan Phillips](https://phillab.host.dartmouth.edu/phillips.html) in the [PhilLab](https://phillab.host.dartmouth.edu/). 

My research aims to combines behavioral experiments and computational modeling to understand how people approach open-ended inference and reasoning problems. I am especially interested in the role of metacognition in problem solving: how do we generate, evaluate, and select between reasoning strategies and problem formulations to efficiently solve a wide range of difficult problems?
